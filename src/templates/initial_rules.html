    <h2 class="center-text">Initial Rule Set</h2>
    <h4 class="center-text">This is the rules that the game started with on
        February 26, 2017</h4>

    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            1 - All players must always abide by all the rules then in effect, in the form in which
            they are then in effect. The rules in the Initial Set are in effect when the game
            begins. The Initial Set consists of Rules 1-11.  Players start the game with zero points.

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            2 - A rule-change is the enactment, repeal, or amendment of a rule.

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            3 - Players shall alternate in alphabetical order by surname, taking one turn
            apiece. A player may voluntarily pass his or her turn, and any player who does not
            initiate their turn within 3 days of the turn starting shall have their turn involuntarily
            skipped and lose 10 points.

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            4 - Each player on their turn proposes one rule-change and has it voted on. Each proposal
            will be given a number, starting with 12, and each proposal shall receive the next
            successive integer whether or not it is adopted. The player will receive a number
            of points equal to the number of the proposed rule-change multiplied by the fraction
            of votes in favor, rounding down.

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            5 - The winner is the first player to achieve 200 (positive) points.

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            6 - A rule-change is adopted if and only if the proposal receives a majority of votes
            in favor and no votes against.  Any player may choose to abstain from the vote.
            If a player fails to vote within 3 days of the vote being called, their vote will
            be assumed to be an abstention. The voting must be completed within 7 days of the
            proposalâ€™s initial introduction or the proposal will be rejected.  The proposing
            player may call for a vote earlier than that, and he or she determines the final
            form of the proposal to be voted on prior to any votes being cast.

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            7 - An adopted rule-change takes full effect immediately at the completion of the vote
            that adopted it.  New rules will be assigned the number of the proposal, and amended
            rules will have their number changed to match the proposal's number.

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            8 - Each player always has exactly one vote.

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            9 - If two or more rules conflict with one another, then the rule with the lowest ordinal number takes precedence.

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            10 - If players disagree about the legality of a move or the interpretation or application of a rule,
            then the player preceding the one moving is to be the Judge and decide the question. Disagreement
            for the purposes of this rule may be created by the insistence of any player. This process is called
            invoking Judgment.

            The previous acting player becomes the Judge, and the Judge gives a decision.

            The Judge's Judgment may be overruled only by a majority of favorable votes with no votes against
            by the other players taken before the next turn is begun.  If a Judge's Judgment is overruled,
            the player prior to the first Judge becomes a new Judge and gives a decision, and do as same as above until
            Judgement is not overruled.

            All Judgments, whether overruled or not, shall be recorded, but future judges are not
            bound by these decisions.

        </div>

    </div>


    <div class="rule">

        <div>
            11 - The state of the game will be managed by a player called the Game Monitor, hereafter referred to as the GM.
            This individual will be responsible for preserving the current state of the Rules,
            maintaining records of any Judgments, the score of each player, and the order of turns.
            In addition, the GM will maintain any other game state information that may become
            necessary as the rules change.  This information will be maintained in a location that
            all the players may access freely.  The GM is Harry Culpan.
